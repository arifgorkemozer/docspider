## Overview

This repository contains a dataset, called DocSpider, for the task of converting natural language (English) to MongoDB querying language (MQL).

Among the files, you can find the scripts developed to generate the DocSpider dataset. Scripts are mainly compatible to work with OpenAI's large language models (e.g GPT3.5, GPT4); however, one can provide the predicted MQLs generated by other LLMs to see the execution accuracy on the DocSpider test dataset.
