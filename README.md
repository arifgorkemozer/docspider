# DocSpider: a Dataset of Cross-Domain Natural Language Querying for MongoDB

#### Arif Görkem Özer, Fırat Çekinel, Pınar Karagöz, İsmail Hakkı Toroslu

## Overview

This repository contains a dataset, called DocSpider, for the task of converting natural language (English) to MongoDB querying language (MQL).

Among the files, you can find the scripts developed to test LLM-generated MQLs against the DocSpider dataset. Scripts are mainly compatible to work with OpenAI's large language models (e.g GPT3.5, GPT4); however, one can provide the predicted MQLs generated by other LLMs to see the execution accuracy on the DocSpider test dataset.

## Requirements for scripts

openai\==0.28.0
pandas\==2.2.2

Also, DocSpider dataset is generated by using the Spider dataset published in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.08887). You need to have "spider" folder downloaded and it should contain:

- database folder
- tables.json
- train_spider.json
- dev.json
- custom_train_gold.sql (a file we provide, based on the original train_gold.sql)
- custom_dev_gold.sql (a file we provide, based on the original dev_gold.sql)
